Assignment:  
• In Chapter 17, we saw an example program that drew a pie chart.
• Modify this program so that the name of each category is shown next to the slice
that represents it.  
• Try to find a pleasing-looking way to automatically position this text that would
work for other data sets as well.  
• You may assume that categories are big enough to leave ample room for their
labels.
• You might need Math.sin and Math.cos again, which are described in Chapter 14.
• Draw the chart twice.
• Once with this customer satisfaction data (data set 1):
o 927 of the customers answered “Satisfied”
o 463 of the customers answered “Neutral”
o 213 of the customers answered “Unsatisfied”
o 510 of the customers answered “No comment”
• Once with this customer satisfaction data (data set 2):
o 104 of the customers answered “Very happy
o 63 of the customers answered “Happy”
o 87 of the customers answered “Neutral”
o 51 of the customers answered “Unhappy”
o 26 of the customers answered “Very unhappy”
o 18 of the customers answered “No comment”
• You may choose your own colors for each pie slice
• Include all your code in a single HTML file named PieChart.htm
• Your code must display both pie charts when the grader clicks on PieChart.htm
• Provide comments for the JavaScript code that explain what each line of code is
doing. See rubric below. You do not have to comment the HTML code.
