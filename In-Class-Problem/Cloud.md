## Summary of Lecture
    The guest start by introduce himself and the company 
    he work for. The topic were about what is the Cloud? 
    Architecture patterns used in the Cloud, Demo building 
    services in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and we get to 
    ask questions at the end of the lecture. Introducte to 
    SaaS (Software as a Service), vendor manages software 
    and data on customer's behalf. Why delivering a SaaS 
    is hard? Host and secure servers have to be in 
    physical location. Have to buy and set up the part for 
    the application to run. Need to negotiate contract 
    with hardware vendors. We learn that the Cloud handles 
    all that "undifferentiated heavy lifting". The service
    that cloud offer are provide computing resources,
    storage, databases, networking, and software. Some of 
    the major cloud vendors are Amazon Web Services, 
    Mocrosoft Azure, and Google Could Platform. Get an 
    overly simplistic view of the cloud product, the 3-tie 
    Architecture. Then talk about Service APIs, which are 
    encapsulates and exposes product functionality. Some 
    of the popular APIs are GitHub REST, GraphQL API, 
    Facebook Graph API,... Then learn about the Monolith 
    Pattern and Micreoservice Pattern. Then the guess talk 
    about building services in GCP. We also get to see how 
    the server look from the view point of the developer.
    A view of Mocro Frontends, the model of end-to-end 
    team with mocro frontends.

## New things I learn.
- Cloud Computing is a way to deliver computing services over the internet. 
- Cloud computing is hard because it require setup and maintenance of servers in physical location.
- Three major cloud vendors are Amazon Web Services, Mocrosoft Azure, and Google Could Platform.
- Learn about the Monolith Pattern, Microservices Pattern, and Serverless Pattern.
- Monolith Advantages: 
    - simple to develop, test, deploy, scale
- Scaling a monolith: 
    -Vertical scaling: Increase the size of the server
    -Horizontal scaling: Add more instances of the server (often see in cloud computing)
- Local balancer for high Availability & Scalling.
- Monolith can break down as a product grows.
- Monolith Challenges: 
    - Large code bases
    - Large excercutables with long compile & startup times
    - Technology lock-in
    - Limited scalability
- Microserve Patterns: 
    - Cohesion:
    - Coupling:
    - Allow distributed development and deployment of the system across large organizations.
- Characteristic of microserve:
    - Small, independent, and loosely coupled
    - Communicate with each other using a well-defined API
    - Deployed independently
    - Can be written in different languages
    - Can be deployed on different platforms
    - Can be scaled independently
    - Can be replaced independently
