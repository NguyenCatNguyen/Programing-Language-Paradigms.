# Appication Programming Interfaces (API)

## In Class Problem (Oct 21)
1. Is the API an RPC? Explain why.
    - Yes, the API is an RPC because it is a remote procedure call. RPCs are used to communicate between two computers over a network which is what the API does. 

2. Is the API SOAP? Explain why.
    - No, the API is not SOAP because SOAP is a protocol that is used to exchange information between computers. The API is not a protocol, it is a remote procedure call.

3. Does the API follow the REST client-server architecture style? Explain why.
    - Yes, the API follows the REST client-server architecture style because it is a client-server architecture style. The client is the user and the server is the API. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the data.

4. Does the API follow the REST stateless architectural style? Explain why.
    - Yes, the API follows the REST stateless architectural style because it is a stateless architectural style. The client does not need to remember the state of the server. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the data.

5. Does the API follow the REST cacheability architectural style? Explain why.
    - Yes, the API follows the REST cacheability architectural style because it is a cacheability architectural style. The client can cache the data that it receives from the server. The client can store the data and use it later.

6. Does the API follow the REST layered system architectural style? Explain why.
    - Yes, the API follows the REST layered system architectural style because it is a layered system architectural style. The client and the server are separated by a layer. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the data.

7. Does the API follow the optional REST code on demand architectural style? 
Explain why.
    - No, the API does not follow the optional REST code on demand architectural style because it is not an optional architectural style. The client does not need to download or execute code in order to use the API.

8. Is it a RESTful API? Explain why.
    - Yes, it is a RESTful API because it follows the REST architectural style. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the data. The client does not need to remember the state of the server. The client can cache the data that it receives from the server. The client and the server are separated by a layer. The client does not need to download or execute code in order to use the API.
