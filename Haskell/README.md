## Type
- A `type` is a name for a collection of related values.
    - The basic types are 
        - Int
        - Float
        - Bool: logical values 
        - Char: single characters
        - String: strings of characters
        - List: 
    - The basic type contains the two logical values True and False.

## Function Types
- A `function` is a mapping from arguments of one type to results of another type:

- `init` takes a list and returns a list with the last element removed.
- `tail` takes a list and returns a list with the first element removed.
- `reverse` takes a list and returns a list with the elements in reverse order.
- `head` takes a list and returns the first element.
- `last` takes a list and returns the last element.
- `length` takes a list and returns the number of elements in the list.
- `null` takes a list and returns True if the list is empty, otherwise it returns False.
- `take` takes a number and a list and returns the first n elements of the list.
